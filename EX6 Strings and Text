Different ways to express and write strings in code.

Code:

x = "There are %d types of people." % 10
binary = "binary"
do_not = "don't"
y = "Those who know %s and those who %s." % (binary, do_not)

print x
print y

print "I said: %r." % x
print "I also said: '%s'." % y

hilarious = False
joke_evaluation = "Isn't that joke so funny?! %r"

print joke_evaluation % hilarious

w = "This is the left side of..."
e = "a string with a right side."

print w + e 


Program output:

Kryptobunny:Python sarah$ python ex6.py
There are 10 types of people.
Those who know binary and those who don't.
I said: 'There are 10 types of people.'.
I also said: 'Those who know binary and those who don't.'.
Isn't that joke so funny?! False
This is the left side of...a string with a right side.


1. Go through this program and write a comment above each line explaining it.


x = "There are %d types of people." % 10 # defines variable x as a string that references a digit.
binary = "binary" # binary is a variable defined as binary
do_not = "don't" # defines the variable do_not as don't
y = "Those who know %s and those who %s." % (binary, do_not) # defines the variable y as a string that references two other strings

print x # prints the x string
print y # prints the y string

print "I said: %r." % x # prints the x variable within a string.
print "I also said: '%s'." % y # prints the y variable within a string

hilarious = False # gives the variable "hilarios" a value of False
joke_evaluation = "Isn't that joke so funny?! %r" # defines the variable joke_evaluation as a string that references another string

print joke_evaluation % hilarious # prints both variables

w = "This is the left side of..." # defines the variable w as a string
e = "a string with a right side." # defines the variable e as a string

print w + e  # prints variable w and e on the same line.


2. Find all the places where a string is put inside a string. There are four places.

x = "There are %d types of people." % 10 # defines variable x as a string that references a digit.
binary = "binary" # binary is a variable defined as binary
do_not = "don't" # defines the variable do_not as don't
y = "Those who know %s and those who %s." % (binary, do_not) # defines the variable y as a string that references two other strings

print x # prints the x string
print y # prints the y string

print "I said: %r." % x # prints the x variable within a string.
print "I also said: '%s'." % y # prints the y variable within a string

hilarious = False # gives the variable "hilarious" a value of False
joke_evaluation = "Isn't that joke so funny?! %r" # defines the variable joke_evaluation as a string that references another string

print joke_evaluation % hilarious # prints both variables

w = "This is the left side of..." # defines the variable w as a string
e = "a string with a right side." # defines the variable e as a string

print w + e  # prints variable w and e on the same line.


3. Are you sure there are only four places? How do you know? Maybe I like lying.

Yes, unless you consider a digit a string. In that case there is one additional string within a string.

4. Explain why adding the two strings w and e with + makes a longer string.

You are telling the program to add the two strings together rather than having them print separately.
