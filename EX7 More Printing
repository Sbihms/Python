Just practice typing and printing.

print "Mary had a little lamb."
print "It's fleece was white as %s." % 'snow'
print "And everywhere that Mary went."
print "." * 10 # what did that do? It printed the . 10 times

end1 = "C"
end2 = "h"
end3 = "e"
end4 = "e"
end5 = "s"
end6 = "e"
end7 = "B"
end8 = "u"
end9 = "r"
end10 = "g"
end11 = "e"
end12 = "r"

# watch that comma at the end. try removing it to see what happens. When I removed the comma it printed the two lines separately rather than together. See below. 
print end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6,
print end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12



Program output:

Kryptobunny:Python sarah$ python ex7.py
Mary had a little lamb.
It's fleece was white as snow.
And everywhere that Mary went.
..........
Cheese Burger


Program output after removing the comma in the highlighted section above

Kryptobunny:Python sarahbihms$ python ex7.py
Mary had a little lamb.
It's fleece was white as snow.
And everywhere that Mary went.
..........

Burger



Adding a comment to each line


print "Mary had a little lamb." # prints the statement
print "It's fleece was white as %s." % 'snow' # print's the statement which refers to the string snow.
print "And everywhere that Mary went." # prints a statement
print "." * 10 # what did that do? # prints the period 10 times

end1 = "C" # simply a variable named end1 which references a single letter
end2 = "h" # a variable which prints a letter
end3 = "e" # a variable which print a letter
end4 = "e" # a variable which prints a letter
end5 = "s" # a variable which prints a letter
end6 = "e" # a variable which prints a letter
end7 = "B" # a variable which prints a letter
end8 = "u" # a variable which prints a letter
end9 = "r" # a variable which prints a letter
end10 = "g" # a variable which prints a letter
end11 = "e" # a variable which prints a letter
end12 = "r" # a variable which prints a letter

# watch that comma at the end. try removing it to see what happens
print end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6, # prints the letters assigned to each variable. The comma acts as a "space" and then the following statement prints.
print end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12 # Rather than printing on a new line, this statement is printed directly next to the one above because of the comma.
