print "What is your birthday" #program that combines integers and strings
Month = raw_input("what is your birth month? ") #user inputs string
Year = raw_input("What year were you born? ") #user inputs integer
print "you were born on", Month + ", " + Year #combines integer and string
raw_input("press enter to exit") #keeps window open until user presses enter

#attempted to create a simple program to combine an integer and string. It works!
