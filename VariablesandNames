Python Code:

cars = 100
space_in_a_car = 4.0
drivers = 30
passengers = 90
cars_not_driven = cars - drivers
cars_driven = drivers
carpool_capacity = cars_driven * space_in_a_car
average_passengers_per_car = passengers / cars_driven

print "There are", cars, "cars available."
print "There are only", drivers, "drivers available."
print "There will be", cars_not_driven, "empty cars today."
print "We can transport", carpool_capacity, "people today."
print "We have", passengers, "to carpool today."
print "We need to put about", average_passengers_per_car, "in each car."

Program output:

Kryptobunny:Python sarah$ python ex4.py
There are 100 cars available.
There are only 30 drivers available.
There will be 70 empty cars today.
We can transport 120.0 people today.
We have 90 to carpool today.
We need to put about 3 in each car.


Study Drills

1. I used 4.0 for space_in_a_car, but is that necessary? What happens if it’s just 4?

Nothing happens - the output is still 120 but without the .0

2. Remember that 4.0 is a “floating point” number. Find out what that means.

A floating point number is any number with a decimal. 

3. Write comments above each of the variable assignments.

#variable for the number of cars total.
cars = 100
#variable showing how many seats are available in each car.
space_in_a_car = 4
#variable for the number of drivers.
drivers = 30
#variable for the amount of passengers. who need a ride.
passengers = 90
#variable which calculates the number of cars that won't be driven due to lack of drivers
cars_not_driven = cars - drivers
#variable for the number of cars which will be driven. This is equal to the number of drivers.
cars_driven = drivers
#variable which calculates how many people can fit in all the cars. 
carpool_capacity = cars_driven * space_in_a_car
#variable which calculates how many people will ride in each car - passengers divided by cars driven.
average_passengers_per_car = passengers / cars_driven

# shows how many total cars are available.
print "There are", cars, "cars available."

#shows how many total drivers are available.
print "There are only", drivers, "drivers available."

# This calculates the amount of cars that won't have drivers.
print "There will be", cars_not_driven, "empty cars today."

#Carpool capacity is calculated by multiplying the number of cars driven by 4 (how many people can fit in each car)
print "We can transport", carpool_capacity, "people today."

#This shows how many passengers need a ride today.
print "We have", passengers, "to carpool today."

#Calculates the average number of passengers per car. Passengers divided by the number of cars driven.
print "We need to put about", average_passengers_per_car, "in each car."

4. Make sure you know what = is called (equals) and that it’s making names for things.

Right - you are assigning a value to an statement.

6. Try running Python as a calculator like you did before and use variable names to do your calculations. Popular variable names are also i, x, and j.

Python Code

i = 5
j = 10
k = 1

#NOTE : PUT A SPACE BEFORE AND AFTER OPERATORS - BAD FORM TO PUT THEM TOGETHER
print i-j
print k-i
print j * k
print i * j
print j/i
