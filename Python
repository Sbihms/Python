Python is an interpreted (scripting) language, not compiled.
 - C# is compiled, think .exe files, binary. The compiler turns it into binary. Fast.
 - Interpreted language does not. It turns into machine code on the fly. It does use up more computer resources.
 - Interp. languages are good for websites since the compiling happens once it lands on a device.

Python looks at white space to end the line.
- easy to figure out what line of code belongs to each statement

Determines the kind of variable based on what data you input. You dont have to define it!

  Ex/
  >>> var1 = 100
  It automatically knows its an integer
  >>> var2 = "hello world"
  Knows its a string
  >>> var3 = 3.14
  knows its a floating point

  You could write:

  >>> var4 = var1 + var3
  >>> print var4
  103.4

We need to output to the screen
  print "xyz"
  print variable

How do we get data from the user?
  >>> raw_input ()

  '\n'
  >>> var6 = raw_input("gimme data")
  gimme data!555
  >>> print var6
  555
  >>>

Examples of simple programs.

Simple addition:

  print "Let's find the sum of two numbers!" #welcome for this program
  firstValue = raw_input("Type a number and press enter: ") #gets user input for first number to add to second value
  secondValue = raw_input("Type another number and press enter: ") #Gets user input for second number
  print "Your total is", int(firstValue) + int(secondValue) # adds the two values together, placing "int" outside the parenthesis confirms that the value should be an integer. You don't technically need it. Why a comma? It concatenates the rest of the statement to the first string and tells it to put in a space.
  raw_input("Press enter to exit") #keeps window open until user presses enter

Example of concatenation
  >>> var1 = "hello"
  >>> var2 = "world"
  >>> print var, var2
  hello world

Example using words:

print "tell me where you live"
state = raw_input("which state do you live in? ") #Gets a string input from the user
city = raw_input("which city do you live in? ") #gets another string input
print "you live in", city + ", " + state #combines our strings and prints the to the screen
raw_input("press enter to exit") #keeps window open until user presses enter

Comment as much as you can so if someone else needs to pick up where you left off.
  However, you can't comment a huge block of code; you have to put a #on each line

Homework: write a program that combines integers and strings

print "What is your birthday" #program that combines integers and strings
Month = raw_input("what is your birth month? ") #user inputs string
type(Month)
Year = raw_input("What year were you born? ") #user inputs integer
type(Year)
print "you were born on", Month + ", " + Year #combines integer and string
raw_input("press enter to exit") #keeps window open until user presses enter
