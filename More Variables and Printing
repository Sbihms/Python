Python Script

my_name = 'Zed A. Shaw'
my_age = 35 # not a lie
my_height = 74 # inches
my_weight = 180 # lbs
my_eyes = 'blue'
my_teeth = 'white'
my_hair = 'Brown'

print "Let's talk about %s." % my_name
print "He's %d inches tall." % my_height
print "He's %d pounds heavy." % my_weight
print "Actually, that's not too heavy."
print "He's got %s eyes and %s hair." % (my_eyes, my_hair)
print "His teeth are usually %s depending on the coffee." % my_teeth

# This line is tricky, try to get it exactly right
print "If I add %d, %d, and %d I get %d." % (my_age, my_height, my_weight, my_age + my_height + my_weight)

Program Output

Kryptobunny:Python sarahbihms$ python ex5.py
Let's talk about Zed A. Shaw.
He's 74 inches tall.
He's 180 pounds heavy.
Actually, that's not too heavy.
He's got blue eyes and Brown hair.
His teeth are usually white depending on the coffee.
If I add 35, 74, and 180 I get 289.



Study Drills

1. Change all the variables so there isn’t the my_ in front. Make sure you change the name everywhere, not just where you used = to set them.

name = 'Zed A. Shaw'
age = 35 # not a lie
height = 74 # inches
weight = 180 # lbs
eyes = 'blue'
teeth = 'white'
hair = 'Brown'

print "Let's talk about %s." % name
print "He's %d inches tall." % height
print "He's %d pounds heavy." % weight
print "Actually, that's not too heavy."
print "He's got %s eyes and %s hair." % (eyes, hair)
print "His teeth are usually %s depending on the coffee." % teeth

# This line is tricky, try to get it exactly right
print "If I add %d, %d, and %d I get %d." % (age, height, weight, age + height + weight)


2. Try more format characters. %r is a very useful one. It’s like saying “print this no matter what.”

I changed %s to %d to see what happened. I got the following error:

Kryptobunny:Python sarah$ python ex5.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "ex5.py", line 9, in <module>
    print "Let's talk about %d." % name
TypeError: %d format: a number is required, not str

I changed all of the format characters to %r and it printed everything literally:

Kryptobunny:Python sarah$ python ex5.py
Let's talk about 'Zed A. Shaw'.
He's 74 inches tall.
He's 180 pounds heavy.
Actually, that's not too heavy.
He's got 'blue' eyes and 'Brown' hair.
His teeth are usually 'white' depending on the coffee.
If I add 35, 74, and 180 I get 289.

3. Try to write some variables that convert the inches and pounds to centimeters and kilos. Do not just type in the measurements. Work out the math in Python.

Code:

name = 'Zed A. Shaw'
age = 35 # not a lie
height = 74 # inches
weight = 180 # lbs
eyes = 'blue'
teeth = 'white'
hair = 'Brown'

print "Let's talk about %s." % name
print "He's %d inches tall." % height
print "His height in centimeters is %d cm" % (height * 2.54) # 2.54 cm in 1 inch
print "He's %d pounds heavy." % weight
print "His weight in kilos is %d kilos." % (weight / 2.2) # 2.2 kilos in 1 pound
print "Actually, that's not too heavy."
print "He's got %s eyes and %s hair." % (eyes, hair)
print "His teeth are usually %s depending on the coffee." % teeth

# This line is tricky, try to get it exactly right
print "If I add %d, %d, and %d I get %d." % (age, height, weight, age + height + weight)

Program  output:

Kryptobunny:Python sarah$ python ex5.py
Let's talk about Zed A. Shaw.
He's 74 inches tall.
His height in centimeters is 187 cm
He's 180 pounds heavy.
His weight in kilos is 81 kilos.
Actually, that's not too heavy.
He's got blue eyes and Brown hair.
His teeth are usually white depending on the coffee.
If I add 35, 74, and 180 I get 289.
