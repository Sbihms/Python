First exercise - "printing" statements.

Note - save python in .py file extension.

To run a python program from terminal, type: python programfilename.py

Here is the short program (written in BBEdit) 

print "Hello World!"
print "Hello Again"
print "I like typing this."
print "This is fun"
print 'Yay! Printing.'
print "I'd much rather you 'not'."
print 'I "said" do not touch this.'

Terminal Commands/output:

Sarahs-MacBook-Air:Python sarah$ python ex1.py
Hello World!
Hello Again
I like typing this.
This is fun
Yay! Printing.
I'd much rather you 'not'.
I "said" do not touch this.




STUDY DRILL

# - I think this is like a comment - place it at the beginning of a line and it won't print.

#print "Hello World!"
print "Hello Again"
#print "I like typing this."
#print "This is fun"
#print 'Yay! Printing.'
#print "I'd much rather you 'not'."
#print 'I "said" do not touch this.'
