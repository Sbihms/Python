Code

print "How old are you?",
age = raw_input()
print "How tall are you?",
height = raw_input()
print "How much do you weigh?",
weight = raw_input()

print "So, you're %r old, %r tall, and %r heavy." % (age, height, weight)

Program output:

Kryptobunny:~ sarah$ cd Python
Kryptobunny:Python sarah$ python ex11.py
How old are you? 33
How tall are you? 5'1
How much do you weigh? 135
So, you're '33' old, "5'1" tall, and '135' heavy.



Study Drills
1. Go online and find out what Python’s raw_input does.

Raw_input takes the input and prints it without identifying if it is a string, numerical value, etc. 

Input by itself tries to give a value to what you type in. Example:

RAW_INPUT

first = raw_input("enter first number: ")
second = raw_input("enter second number: ")
print first + second

If you enter 2 as the numbers it prints: 22

INPUT

first = input("enter first number: ")
second = input("enter second number: ")
print first + second

If you enter 2 as the numbers it adds them and gives you 4.


2. Write another “form” like this to ask some other questions.

ROCKSTAR NAME GENERATOR!

print "Welcome to the rock star name generator!"
print "What was your first pet's name?"
pet = raw_input()
print "What is the name of the street you grew up on?"
street = raw_input()
print "What was your highschool mascot?"
mascot = raw_input()

print "Your rock star name is %s %s %s!" % (pet, street, mascot)
