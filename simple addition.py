#This simple sample code came from youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnnfiqZpGVc. This is my write up of the code. My first attempt!

#Pitfalls: Pasted this code from another doc but after trying to run it in terminal I got an error stating "unexpeced indent". Deleted indents. Ran code and got the same error. Discovered there was a white space in front of each line. Deleted white space and ran code. It worked! Yay for my first program!!!
