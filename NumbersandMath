Program written in python

# prints the beginning statement. Nothing fancy.
print "I will now count my chickens:"

# Calculates the number of hens. Follows PEMDAS order (parenthesis, exponent, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction)
print "Hens", 25 + 30 / 6

# Calculates the number of roosters. 100 - (25*3%4) = 100 - (75 divided by 4 is 18.75 --> 18 * 4 is 72 (leaving 3 remaining from the 75)
print "Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4

# prints the second statement
print "Now I will count the eggs:"

# order of operations: PEMDAS order of ops - 1/4 and 4%2 are calculated first. Python v. 2 truncates fractions so 1/4 = 0.25 = 0 in python. 4%2 = 4/2 = 2 --> 2*2 = 4 --> 4-4=0
print 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6

# 3+2 is 5 and 5-7 is -2. It is NOT true that 5 is less than -2.
print "Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?"

#This statement shows that the statement above is false.
print 3 + 2 < 5 - 7

# this prints the question and then calculates the answer
print "What is 3 + 2?", 3 + 2

# again, this prints the statement and then calculates the answer
print "What is 5 - 7?", 5 - 7

# statement
print "Oh, that's why it's false."

#statement
print "How about some more."

#question followed by the operation. Once python calculates this it will state true or false.
print "Is it greater?", 5 > -2

# question followed by a calculation. Python will print either true or false.
print "Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= -2

#question followed by a calculation which python will tell us is either true or false.
print "Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2

>>> 7/4

>>> 12+1
13
>>> 12+1-1
12
>>> 12-1+1
12
>>> 

I discovered that python includes numbers after a decimal as long as you input the decimal initially. See 7.0 / 4.0 and 7/4 above.

Also, python reads left to right if the order of operations includes only addition and subtraction. So 12-1+1 = 12 (rather than 10, if you do the addition first). 


Rewriting the initial exercise with floating points included:

print "I will now count my chickens:"

print "Hens", 25.0 + 30.0 / 6.0

print "Roosters", 100.0 - 25.0 * 3.0 % 4.0

print "Now I will count the eggs:"

print 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4.0 % 2.0 - 1 / 4 + 6

print "Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?"

print 3 + 2 < 5 - 7

print "What is 3 + 2?", 3 + 2

print "What is 5 - 7?", 5 - 7

print "Oh, that's why it's false."

print "How about some more."

print "Is it greater?", 5 > -2

print "Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= -2

print "Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2
