Code

formatter = "%r %r %r %r" # assigns the value of %r reference to the variable titled "formatter"

print formatter % (1, 2, 3, 4) # prints the variable titled formatter which references these numers. They print out in order with no punctuation.
print formatter % ("one", "two", "three", "four") # prints the formatter variable which references these strings. Because we used %r and not %s they show up with quotes around them.
print formatter % (True, False, False, True) # prints the formatter variable which references true and false.
print formatter % (formatter, formatter, formatter, formatter) # prints the formatter variable which references itself so it prints %r four times.
print formatter % (
    "I had this thing.",
    "That you could type up right.",
    "But it didn't sing.",
    "So I said goodnight."
) # prints the variable formatter which references the four strings in quotation marks. They all print on the same line since they are separated with commas.
