If you have an error, it will look like this:
$ python ex/ex1.py
File "ex/ex1.py", line 3
print "I like typing this.
^
SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal

It’s important that you can read these, since you will be making many of these mistakes. Even I make many of these mistakes. Let’s look at this line by line.

1. Here we ran our command in the Terminal to run the ex1.py script.
2. Python then tells us that the fi le ex1.py has an error on line 3.
3. It then prints this line for us.
4. Then it puts a ^ (caret) character to point at where the problem is. Notice the missing "(double- quote) character?
5. Finally, it prints out a SyntaxError and tells us something about what might be the error. Usually these are very cryptic, but if you copy that text into a search engine, you will find someone else who’s had that error and you can probably figure out how to fi x it.
